# rumoro_theresa_sleep_walk_app

  This app compares oneâ€™s hours asleep with their steps for the day. This program uses the terminal to connect with the user.
The user put up to 7 days' worth of data. This is a menu-based program that will introduce the user to the program and then prompt them
with text to input their data. After they do that they will be able to analyze their data with an average 
data set that I will pull from the web.
	To make the users want to use this program, I can add some menu options for tips on how to sleep better and how 
to get more steps. If this option is available, a menu-based option will be added to find the resources that I used 
throughout the program, such as where I found the average data and where I found the tips.
