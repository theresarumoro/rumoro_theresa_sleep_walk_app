# rumoro_theresa_sleep_walk_app

  For my project, I will create an app that will compare oneâ€™s hours asleep with their steps for the day. 
This program will use the terminal to connect with the user. I will have the user put up to 7 days' worth 
of data. This will be a menu-based program that will introduce the user to the program and then prompt them
with text to input their data. After they do that they will be able to analyze their data with an average 
data set that I will pull from the web. They can also view their data in graphs and averages.
	To make the users want to use this program, I will add some menu options for tips on how to sleep better and how 
to get more steps. I will then have a menu-based option to find the resources that I used throughout the program, 
such as where I found the average data and where I found the tips. I also want to implement a database where the 
user can put their data. If I have time, I will try to learn how to encrypt the information that the user gives to 
protect their personal information.
  I plan to spend around 30-50 hours on this project and will use multiple classes to organize the many
different aspects of this program. I will spend the first part of my time figuring out the flow and design
of the program, the second part creating the plan, the third part coding, and the last part cleaning everything up.
